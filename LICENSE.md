# PHPfox Premium License Agreement

This PHPfox License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and PHPfox ("PHPfox") for the licensing of the PHPfox software, which includes computer software and any associated media ("Software").

PHPfox, its source code and files are original works exclusively owned by PHPfox and subject to copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.

Any and all intellectual property rights in the Software, including the original works, or parts thereof, in any form, are and shall remain the exclusive property of PHPfox and/or its licensors. Nothing in this Agreement intends to transfer any such intellectual property rights to you. You will not take any action to jeopardize, limit or interfere with PHPfox's rights.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, PHPfox hereby grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable license to download, install and use one instance of the Software and to use it on only one domain name extension (e.g. .com, .net, or .org). You may not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, pledge, re-sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Software "Lite/Network/Package License" in any form, on a temporary or permanent basis, without the prior written consent of PHPfox.

A license is valid only in relation to the designated license owner stated at the time of purchase of the license and any request for transfer of ownership must be made in writing to PHPfox for consideration. Subscription based "Monthly Licenses" can not be transferred. If the license is purchased by a registered company and no specific person is designated as the license owner, then the licenseowner will be deemed to be the then current CEO of the company. A company which is not registered at the time of purchase must name a designate of license ownership. If the company fails to do so, the license will not be valid.
